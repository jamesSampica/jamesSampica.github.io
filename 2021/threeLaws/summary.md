# Three software laws every Agile team should know
## 2021/05/09

This is by no means an extensive list but if you work in a self-managing team in a complex environment you're going to want to know these by heart.

## Little's Law

John Little's theorem published initially in 1954. The theory states that the long-term average number L of customers in a stationary system is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate λ multiplied by the average time W that a customer spends in the system. This is expressed algebraically as...

L = λW

This theory has uses outside of software development and can be applied to many different types of systems. Without having to calculate anything there are a few consequences you can remember.

1. Increasing WIP (L) will always increase

## Conway's Law

Initially named after Melvin Conway who created the idea in 1967. The adage follows...

> Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.

This one is harder to initially conceptualize but I am sure most people have experienced this sort of disfunction at some point in their careers.

## Brooke's Law

Invented by Fred Brooks in the 1975 book _The Mythical Man-Month_. The following is stated...

> Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later

In command and control environments where managers are not familiar with the differences between creative innovation and assembly-line factory work it is tempting to treat developers as interchangeable as hammers.
